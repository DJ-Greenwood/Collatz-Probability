\section{Example Analysis: \( n = 7 \)}

\subsection{Sequence Path}
The sequence generated by applying the Collatz function to \( n = 7 \) is:
\[
7 \rightarrow 22 \rightarrow 11 \rightarrow 34 \rightarrow 17 \rightarrow 52 \rightarrow 26 \rightarrow 13 \rightarrow 40 \rightarrow 20 \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 16 \rightarrow 8 \]
\[
 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1
\]
This sequence illustrates both the probabilistic transitions between odd and even numbers and the deterministic role of powers of 2 in ensuring eventual convergence.

\subsection{Phase Analysis}
The sequence can be divided into two distinct phases: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Initial phase (until reaching a power of 2):} 
    \[
    7 \rightarrow 22 \rightarrow 11 \rightarrow 34 \rightarrow 17 \rightarrow 52 \rightarrow 26 \rightarrow 13 \rightarrow 40 \rightarrow 20 \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 16
    \]
    \textbf{Steps: 12}
    
    During this phase, the sequence alternates between odd and even numbers. The odd values undergo the \( 3n+1 \) transformation, introducing even factors that enter the probabilistic halving process. The process continues until the sequence reaches \( 16 \), a power of 2.
    
    \item \textbf{Reduction by powers of 2:}
    \[
    16 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1
    \]
    \textbf{Steps: 4}
    
    Once the sequence reaches a power of 2, it follows a deterministic descent to 1, highlighting the attractor nature of powers of 2 in the Collatz process.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Total Steps:} The total number of steps taken is 16, with 17 numbers appearing in the sequence. This matches the theoretical prediction based on expected behavior, reinforcing the logarithmic upper bound:
\[
E[T(n)] \leq c \log(n) + k.
\]
This example further supports the probabilistic framework, demonstrating how odd numbers contribute to sequence growth before entering the halving process and ultimately reaching the deterministic power-of-2 funnel.
